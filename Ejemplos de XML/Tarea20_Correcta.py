# CHANGE MAKING BY GREEDY ALGORITHMS

# Instructions:
# Write a program to solve the change making problem using a greedy algorithm. 
# Modify only the functions marked with the TODO comment. 
# DON'T ADD ANY 'print' FUNCTION.

    # Solve the change making problem using a greedy algorithm.
    # Use as greedy choice the largest denomination of coin which is not greater
    # than the remaining amount to be made.
    # Available denominations are stored in 'denominations' and the amount
    # to be made is stored in 'W'.
    # Assume you can pick as many coins as you need of every denomination.
    # Store the resulting coins in 'solution'
    # For example, if W = 99 and currencies = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100]
    # 'solution' should be [50, 20, 20, 5, 2, 2]
