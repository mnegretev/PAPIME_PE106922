 * MATRIX MULTIPLICATION
 *
 * Instructions:
 * Multiply three matrices whose orders are given by a0Xa1, a1Xa2, a2Xa3
 * The three matrices must be filled with random integers in [-99,99]
 * The program must print the three generated matrices and the result of the product.
 * Values a0, a1, a2 and a3 are passed as command line arguments.
 *
 * IT IS MANDATORY TO USE THE 'malloc' FUNCTION TO ALLOCATE ALL THE SPACE NEEDED
 * TO STORE THE MATRICES ELEMENTS.
 * THE USE OF THE BRACKET NOTATION [] IS NOT ALLOWED. STUDENTS MUST USE POINTERS INSTEAD.
 * MODIFY ONLY THE SECTIONS MARKED WITH THE 'TODO' COMMENT.
 * DON'T MODIFY THE MAIN FUNCTION.
 * DON'T ADD ANY 'printf' FUNCTION.
 *
 * This work was supported by UNAM-DGAPA under grant PAPIME-PE106922
