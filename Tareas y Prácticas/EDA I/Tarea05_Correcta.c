 * LEXICOGRAPHIC STRING COMPARISON
 *
 * Instructions:
 * Write a program to compare two strings.
 * The program receives as command line arguments the two strings to be compared
 * and returns the integer corresponding to the comparison result. 
 * The comparison to be implemented must be the same than the strcmp function
 * THE USE OF THE STRCMP FUNCTION INCLUDED IN THE STRING LIBRARY IS NOT ALLOWED
 * MODIFY ONLY THE string_compare FUNCTION
 * DON'T ADD ANY 'printf' FUNCTION.
 *
 * This work was supported by UNAM-DGAPA under grant PAPIME-PE106922
