# MATRIX CHAIN MULTIPLICATION
#
# Instructions:
# Write a program to solve the Matrix Chain Multiplication problem
# using dynamic programming. The chain of N matrices is given by an
# array of N+1 integers, e.g., an array [3 1 4 1 5] represents four
# matrices with orders 3x1, 1x4, 4x1 and 1x5.
# The program must calculate the best multiplication order to perform
# the minimun number of scalar multiplications.
#
# Modify only the sections marked with the TODO comment. 
# DON'T ADD ANY 'print' FUNCTION.
#
# This works was supported by UNAM-DGAPA under grant PAPIME PE106922
