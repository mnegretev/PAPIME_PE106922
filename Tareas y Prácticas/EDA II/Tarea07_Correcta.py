# N-QUEEN PROBLEM
#
# Instructions:
# Write a program to solve the N-Queen problem using backtracking.
# The chess board is represented by a two-dimensional array
# with '1' in cell [i][j] if there is a queen in it, and '0', otherwise.
#
# Modify only the sections marked with the TODO comment. 
# DON'T ADD ANY 'print' FUNCTION.
#
# This work was supported by UNAM-DGAPA under grant PAPIME PE106922

    # given the current board configuration.
    # Hint: You can check the difference in X and Y between a queen
    # and the position of interest. If delta_X== 0, delta_Y==0 or delta_x=delta_y
    # then it is not a safe position.

    # - For all columns in row:

    #         - Place Quenn in row, col
    #         - If placing Queen in row,col leads to a solution (check this recursively)
