# INSERTION SORT
#
# Instructions:
# Write a program to sort, in ascending order, an array of integers using the
# Insertion Sort algorithm.
# Integers to be sorted are passed as command line arguments. 
#
# Modify only the functions marked with the TODO comment. 
# DON'T ADD ANY 'print' FUNCTION.
#
# This work was supported by UNAM-DGAPA under grant PAPIME PE106922
